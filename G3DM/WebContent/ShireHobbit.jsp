	<h1>Shire Hobbit</h1>
	<p>
		Your people are a reclusive sort, caring little for events occurring outside of your country. Legend speaks of your ancestors as great allies to the fallen kingdom of Arnor, but telling such tales bring nothing but trouble to your borders and are better left unsaid. By good fortune, evil has not encroached the Shire for generations, allowing your people to become a carefree stock. They tend to their gardens and shun the troubles brought upon by industrialization. Shire Hobbits scorn journeying away from the safety of their homes to seek foolish adventure, and instead find comfort in comfy chairs with fresh pipe-weed and good books. Still, it is known to all within the country of the Bag End homestead, belonging to strange Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo. They are an odd sort, looking for trouble when one should instead enjoy a homely fire and a nice meal. But as tales of grey happenings occurring far from the borders of your home begin to spread, it is whispered that trouble may soon come looking for you.
