	<h1>Dwaf of the Iron Hills</h1>
	<p>
		As decedents of Durin’s Folk, your people once lived among the first great house of the Dwarves. Expanding into the Grey Mountains, your ancestors sought to uncover the rich mineral wealth from lands outside of Khazad-dûm. However, as attacks of Dragons grew more frequent, your people where led by Gror, son of Dain, to new salvation. Settling in the Iron Hills, Gror established a powerful stronghold in the North, challenging the enemies of Middle Earth. Today, the halls of your people remain the strongest of all Dwarven settlements, establishing strong relationships with Men and Hobbits, and thwarting the advance of vile Orcs into the North. Your people are of a noble stock, and are eager to give support to those who call for it. But will strength of the Iron Hills be enough to thwart the creeping tides of doom that work their way across Middle Earth?
