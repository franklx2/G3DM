	<h2>Elf</h2> 
	
	<p>
		Elves were one of the two original sentient races in the Omega galaxy, the other being the Dwarves. The elves and dwarves originally lived in relative peace for hundreds of thousands of years, until the Life Weavers created the Sapiens. This creation of sentient flesh and bone conflicted with the commonly held Elvish belief known simply as “The Way of the Verse.” Elves that followed this system believed that sentient life was sacred, and the creation of which only belonged to the cosmic powers in the universe. This belief system caused them to wage a religious war on the Dwarven race, known as the Evolutionary War. The end of this war sent the remaining dwarf and elf populations into the Age of Silence, where all technological and philosophical progress ground to a halt, and nearly all of the historical records and developed technologies were lost or fell into disrepair. This age lasted a hundred thousand years, and it was not until two hundred thousand years after the end of the war that the Elven Elron Democracy and Dwarven Delduin Republic were formed. Now, very few Elves follow a collective belief system, though some still hold true to The Way of the Verse, and therefore harbor the deep-seated hatred of Humans.
