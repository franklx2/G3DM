	<h2>Faye</h2> 
	
	<p>
		Fayes are the most unusual of the six primary sentient races in the galaxy. Their population originated in the Alpha Galaxy, though it is unknown exactly from where in that galaxy, as very few Fayes ever put effort into recording their past, instead focusing on existing in harmony with the cosmic powers of the universe. Fayes are not biologically formed beings, and they do not reproduce in the same manner as the other fully organic races of the galaxy. Despite their outward organic appearance, they are created when other Fayes gather inorganic matter in the form of minerals and earthen material, and mold the matter into the shape of a new Faye. The new form is then infused with the energy of a nearby star, and this energy brings the new Faye to life. Due to this process, all Fayes contain a form of inert napalm within their skeletal structures. This causes their eyes to glow with a soft light, and also gives their bodies a faint glowing aura.
