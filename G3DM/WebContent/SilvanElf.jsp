		Silvan Elf: Your people descend from the Avari, the elves of first days that were unwilling to take the Great Journey to Aman. Fascinated by the wondrous landscape of the lands to the east and south of the Misty Mountains, your ancestors left to explore Middle Earth much later than the other elves. Led by King Denethor, your woodland peoples eventually encountered the Sindar realms in Beleriand. While allowed refuge within the halls of your Sindarin cousins, your people where for the most part untrusted by the Noldor, who considered them to be lesser. With the majority of your people slain in the first age by the first dark lord, you have been forced to become a reclusive race, taking to the deep woods and shadows for refuge. Your mastery of the bow is unmatched and you are naturally adept in concealing yourself. But with so few of your people remaining and no unifying leadership, will your people survive the coming shadow?</br>
