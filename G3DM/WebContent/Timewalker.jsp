		<h3>Abilities</h3>
		Starting Abilities</br>
		<ol style="1">
			<li>Time Stream – Timewalker creates a slipstream in space-time between themselves and their target, then fires a shot through the stream, doing instant damage equal to a d4 x Power Level. Any character caught in between Timewalker and their target rolls a d20 + WIL mod vs the Timewalker’s d20 + WIL mod. If Timewalker rolls higher, the character is stunned for one turn. Time Stream has a range of 25 feet.</li>		
			<li>CQC Specialist – For the next number of turns equal to 2 x Power Level used, Timewalker gains +1 to the final damage calculation of any of their attacks if they are 15 feet or closer to their target.</li>
		</ol>
				
		Lvl 3 </br>
		<ul>
			<li>Wormhole – Timewalker opens a wormhole in front of them, teleporting any target more than 25 feet away to a spot 5 feet in front of the Timewalker. Timewalker can then attack using a normal attack roll.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Lvl 5 </br>
		<ul>
			<li> Desync – Timewalker rolls a d20 + WIL mod vs target’s d20 + WIL mod. If Timewalker’s roll is higher, they slow the target for a number of turns equal to 1 + power level used. Target can only move 5 ft/turn and cannot attack and move in the same turn. Target also has all DC rolls halved.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Lvl 7 </br>
		<ul>
			<li>Rewind – Timewalker reverses time for an instant to undo the injuries of an ally. Rewind heals the ally by the amount of damage they most recently took.</li>
