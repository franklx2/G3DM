	<h2>Human</h2>
	<p>
		
		Originally known as Sapiens, humans were a Dwarven creation of genetic engineering. Designed to be the next step in the evolutionary process, humans are naturally physically and intellectually adept. Humans were created by the Dwarven bioengineering order known as the Life Weavers. Their creation caused a conflict of beliefs between the dwarves and the elves, and sparked the three hundred-year-long Evolutionary War. After the group of original humans was sent in bio-stasis by the Life Weavers out into the galaxy, their transport ship crashed on planet Amun. They awakened one hundred thousand years later, and quickly formed the Sapius Empire, which became one of the most respected powers in the galaxy. The original human culture believed in no figures of higher power, instead they created fictional idols to represent their ideals and values. Their home planet was named after their original idol, the Idol of Perfection.
