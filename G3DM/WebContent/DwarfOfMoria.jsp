	<h1>Dwaf of Moria</h1> 
	<p>
		Your people are the direct decedents of Durin, first of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, who established the great halls of Khazad-dûm long ago. Your ancient city was the envy of Dwarves, Men, and Elves alike, enriched by great smithing and masonry artisans, and the harvest of mithril. With the rise of the Sauron during the Second Age, your people sealed the enchanted doors of their great halls, beginning a long seclusion from the outside world. Expanding your search for treasure, your people dug deep into the Misty Mountains. Great riches where uncovered, as well as abysmal horrors that should have been left forgotten with the pass of history. An ancient evil called Durin’s Bane slew many of your people, and drove the survivors from their halls. Your people became nomadic, but never lost hope to one day reclaim the right to their home. But as darkness prepares to fall across the land, there is no telling what stirs within Moria.
