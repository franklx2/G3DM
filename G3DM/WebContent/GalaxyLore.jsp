	<h2>Races</h2>
		
	<h3>Orcs</h3>  
	<p>
		The orc race was formed by interspecies breeding between the elves and dwarves that escaped the Evolutionary War as Monorgran’s Pilgrims. Their origin world is planet Rameses, as this was the planet that the pilgrim’s finally landed on and colonized. Orc culture is generally feudalistic, and almost completely merit-based. Orcs often value personal character and determination over natural talent and social status. 
	</p>
		
	<h3>Humans</h3>
	<p>
		Originally known as Sapiens, humans were a Dwarven creation of genetic engineering. Designed to be the next step in the evolutionary process, humans are naturally physically and intellectually adept. Humans were created by the Dwarven bioengineering order known as the Life Weavers. Their creation caused a conflict of beliefs between the dwarves and the elves, and sparked the three hundred-year-long Evolutionary War. After the group of original humans was sent in bio-stasis by the Life Weavers out into the galaxy, their transport ship crashed on planet Amun. They awakened one hundred thousand years later, and quickly formed the Sapius Empire, which became one of the most respected powers in the galaxy. The original human culture believed in no figures of higher power, instead they created fictional idols to represent their ideals and values. Their home planet was named after their original idol, the Idol of Perfection.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Halflings</h3>
	<p>
		The halflings were originally a group of Fayes that wanted to immerse themselves in the earthen world, in order to sharpen their perception and understanding of the biological half of existence. They formed the Beta Collective, and colonized planet Tritional. The Beta Collective formed a subterranean society and evolved into a more biological form over time, forming the Halfling race. Halflings, like Fayes, generally keep to themselves, though it is not uncommon to see them in the day to day life of the galaxy. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Elves</h3>
	<p>
		Elves were one of the two original sentient races in the Omega galaxy, the other being the Dwarves. The elves and dwarves originally lived in relative peace for hundreds of thousands of years, until the Life Weavers created the Sapiens. This creation of sentient flesh and bone conflicted with the commonly held Elvish belief known simply as “The Way of the Verse.” Elves that followed this system believed that sentient life was sacred, and the creation of which only belonged to the cosmic powers in the universe. This belief system caused them to wage a religious war on the Dwarven race, known as the Evolutionary War. The end of this war sent the remaining dwarf and elf populations into the Age of Silence, where all technological and philosophical progress ground to a halt, and nearly all of the historical records and developed technologies were lost or fell into disrepair. This age lasted a hundred thousand years, and it was not until two hundred thousand years after the end of the war that the Elven Elron Democracy and Dwarven Delduin Republic were formed. Now, very few Elves follow a collective belief system, though some still hold true to The Way of the Verse, and therefore harbor the deep-seated hatred of Humans.
	</p>	
	
	<h3>Dwarves</h3>
	<p>
		The Dwarves shared most of their known history with the Elves. This was due to the actions of the Life Weavers and the war waged by the Elven race. Similar to Elves, modern Dwarves do not follow any overarching beliefs, though they still tend to have an interest and aptitude in all forms of engineering. (Dwarven history is recounted in the previous section describing Elvish history.)
	</p>	
		
	<h3>Fayes</h3> 
	<p>
		Fayes are the most unusual of the six primary sentient races in the galaxy. Their population originated in the Alpha Galaxy, though it is unknown exactly from where in that galaxy, as very few Fayes ever put effort into recording their past, instead focusing on existing in harmony with the cosmic powers of the universe. Fayes are not biologically formed beings, and they do not reproduce in the same manner as the other fully organic races of the galaxy. Despite their outward organic appearance, they are created when other Fayes gather inorganic matter in the form of minerals and earthen material, and mold the matter into the shape of a new Faye. The new form is then infused with the energy of a nearby star, and this energy brings the new Faye to life. Due to this process, all Fayes contain a form of inert napalm within their skeletal structures. This causes their eyes to glow with a soft light, and also gives their bodies a faint glowing aura.
