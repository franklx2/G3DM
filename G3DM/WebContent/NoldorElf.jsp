	<h1>Noldor Elf</h1> 
	<p>
		As a decedent of one of the very first Eldar clans, you and your people possess both a wondrous and tragic history. You were the second of the elves to journey west to Aman, where they prospered for years. No other race in the history of the three ages has matched your people’s mastery of warfare and gem crafting. Nor have they matched your people’s thirst for knowledge of all things. This curiosity has played the most significant role in the decline of your people’s great civilization. In an attempt to reclaim the stolen Silmarils of Fëanor, your people returned to Middle Earth, where they established great kingdoms and faced generations of conflict against the first dark lord. Your people were then deceived by Sauron years later, during the forging of the rings of power. Since then, your civilization has dwindled to only a handful of communities. As a great shadow grows to the south in Mordor, your people begin to again sail west to Aman. Will you join them in leaving your ancestral home, or stand to face the growing threat?
