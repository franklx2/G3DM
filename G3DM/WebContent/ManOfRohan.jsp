	<h1>Man of Rohan</h1> 
	<p>
		As a Rohirrim, you and your people are descendent from the ancient northern humans of Rhovanion. Your people did not travel west into Beleriand like the Edain ancestors of Gondor and Andor, but instead chose to inhabit the vale of Calenardhon, establishing the kingdom of Rohan. Coming into contact with the men of Gondor many years later, your people became great allies and pledged an oath of service should the realms of men ever be threatened. Your people are mighty horse-lords, known for their superior cavalry and mounted training, which has been serviced in many battles. Your lands are not without trouble, however. As a once strong allegiance with Isengard has grown cold and your beloved King Th√©oden has fallen ill, it is questionable if your people will ever be able to muster support to meet the shadow that grows in the east.
