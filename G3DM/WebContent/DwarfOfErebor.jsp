	<h1>Dwarf of Erebor</h1> 
	<p>
		Your people were among the strongest decedents of Durin’s Folk during the Third Age, and sought to uncover glorious wealth for the halls of Khazad-dûm. Led by King Thráin, your people founded a great hall in the Lonely Mountains, and uncovered a great prize called the Arkenstone. Establishing prosperous trade with the men of Dale, your people achieved an affluence that lasted for many years. It was not to last however, as your halls where sacked by the terrible wyrm Smaug, who drove your people from underground. Thanks to the restoration efforts of Thorin II and Company, as well as a curious Hobbit, the Halls of Erebor where eventually reclaimed. While peace resides again within your home, and relations with the Men of Dale and Elves of Mirkwood recover, there is much to be done to restore the glory it once possessed. As darkness encroaches the surrounding lands, the question remains if the might of Erebor will ever be fully restored.
