	<h1>Buckland Hobbit</h1> 
	<p>
		Your people are descended from Hobbits of the Shire, who colonized the lands east of the Brandywine River. Your people are natural river folk, focusing their time and craftsmanship into making fine boats and fishing rods. As the only Hobbits to use boats, your lands have prospered in shipping commerce across the Brandywine, with a notable crossing point being the Bucklebury ferry. Unlike your Shire cousins, your people are less naïve to the dangers of the world, and are prepared to come to arms should the Horn of Buckland ever be blown. Living on the borders of the evil Old Forrest, your people have become extremely cautious, and grow High Hay to protect their borders. As an independent land from the farthings of the Shire, your people seek to establish strong commercial relationships with Men and Dwarves around their lands. But trouble to the East begins to stir, and has disrupted the prosperous activity your people once enjoyed.
