	<h1>Dunedain Ranger</h1>
	<p>
	As successors of the fallen kingdom of Arnor, you and your people live scattered amongst the wilds of Rhudaur. Having bared the brunt of a long time brutal assault by Sauron’s lieutenant, the Witch-king of Angmar, your once proud kingdom fell ages ago. Your people are the direct decedents of the legendary Númenóreans, the mightiest of men to exist in Middle Earth. As such, your people have been blessed with nobility of spirit and body, standing tall and possessing great wisdom. Your lifespan runs long as well, exceeding three times that of normal men. As caretakers of the northern lands of your forefathers, you have mastered an understanding of the wilds. You seek to use your allegiance with beasts and mastery of path to strike back at your enemy, and reclaim your once great homeland. But without one to take leadership in your sister kingdom of Gondor, reestablishing the realm of men seems but a distant hope.
