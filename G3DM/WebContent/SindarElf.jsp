	<h1>Sindar Elf</h1> 
	<p>
		Your people are the distant decedents of the Teleri, the third of the elves to journey west to Aman.  They did not complete their travel however, and followed King Thingol into the forests of Beleriand. Your people developed a great love for Middle Earth, watching over its forests and establishing powerful realms. The pride of your people has grown over the ages, guiding them to develop a distinct and prominent culture. As the original Eldar language of Quenya was abandoned by your people in favor of the newly crafted Sindarin, your ancestors sought to stubbornly establish themselves as the dominant elven force of the eastern lands. This has put your people at odds with the Noldor from time to time, even resulting in periods of violence. With the fall of your ancestral woodland realm near the end of the First Age, your people have since established independent communities east of the Misty Mountains. But as shadow begins to grow in Mordor, more of the Sindar begin to long for journey to Aman.
