	<h1>Man of Gondor</h1>
	<p>
		As a citizen of the last remaining great human kingdom, you and your people live on the front lines of the Dark Lord’s advancement. Like the lost kingdom of Arnor, your country was established by the legendary Númenóreans of old. Ages of breeding with common men has dulled your senses however, and you have lost the birthright of your ancestors. With the ashen sky of Mordor in plain sight of Minis Tirith, and the ruins of the once great capital of Osgiliath at your doorstep, your people are served an ever present reminder of the hardships they have faced at the hands of the enemy. As the threat of war looms over your country, your people cling hopefully to the return of the lost Dúnedain bloodline of the king to retake Gondor’s throne and deliver you through prospective doom. Years of battle has hardened your people, and made you naturally bold. But even the strongest of men can lose themselves in times of great despair. Will you abandon faith at the coming darkness, or rise to stand against the enemies of Middle Earth?</br>
